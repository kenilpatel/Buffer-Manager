Buffer Manager

It is very important part of DBMS system and there exists several buffer management techniques which greatly impact the performance of DBMS system. In this project I have implmented several policies such as LRU, MRU, Random, FIFO, Clock etc.

In some context LRU is useful but as we know there is no silver bullet so here I compared a performance for each replacement policies by giving it a same type of input. One of the input contains the sequential flooding in which MRU outperforms LRU
